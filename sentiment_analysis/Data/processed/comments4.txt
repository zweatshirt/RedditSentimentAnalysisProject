At what point would you start running into very formidable opponents. Like I imagine your chances of getting an old lady or a child the first few rounds is pretty significant. I’d say around round 5 or 6 you’re probably going to have some tough opponents. 
That's true for some sports, but we don't know what sport we are talking about here. 
I like to imagine in this scenario each round is wildly different. From rock paper scissors to pole vaults, holding breath underwater to potato sack races, hell they will throw in a just broad who guesses closest to a number 1-1000 round. 
Oh I thought it was just straight gonna be a fight to the death Oops 
Don't worry, that's where I went too. 
Why did I think this too lmao 
Because death matches are the truest form of sports entertainment and anyone who says otherwise is wrong 
I say we do just one round and drop the global population by 4,000,000,000 people 
This could be an interesting TV Show 
Viewership would really drop off during the most pivotal fights. 
The final should be a banger but nobody would be able to watch it. Or even comment it 
Also, murder is easier than most physical sports, allowing children and grannies a fair chance.  Blank stare 
You know what, that actually sounds fun 
Like some kind of squid game. 
The world ball-in-a-cup tournament! 
oh you think its something other than fighting to the death 😂  nah its fighting to the death 
Chancla throwing would definitely have some tough old ladies at the end. 
Yeah of course old ladies would destroy most of you in bingo 😅 
For some unfounded reason I assumed it was rock paper scissors we were playing 
The question is, do you think you’re stronger than half the planet? Because in round 2, you’re fighting the stronger half. 
Or you're fighting someone who got paired with a kid or some shit 
Depends if there's seeding in this tournament or not 
Surely it has to start locally for logistics reasons. Start in your city, then local area, broad area, then you start to get national and international. 
Could still be plenty of seeding even on the city level, make sure all boxers and MMA guys are up against preschoolers and stuff in the first round.  Wouldn't want the title fight to happen round one if you could help it, yah know? 
"Guys, I know when we planned this global death match we said we'd leave ethics at the door. But, I'm still just struggling a bit with the fact that we've intentionally paired a disabled 1 year old with Tyson Fury." 
Nah. Big enough population size seeding isn't needed. The matchups can be totally random and still be close enough to what you want anyway 
Any adult male with no physical disabilities is very likely in the top half of strength in the planet, so it is probably not that hard 
Around 25 percent of the world is under 15 years of age and 10 percent is over 65 years of age. As long as you're a physically functional adult you're likely already above 35% of the people. Of course there are still 15 years old and 65 years old who can kick some ass but they're a minority. 
This is really important and so many people aren't taking into consideration population distribution. The majority of the population are people under the age of 12, over 60, disabled, or sick. What are the odds someone makes it to the top by defeating only really weak opponents?  It's possible the top fighter just ends up being a 50 year old woman who'd recently taken a few self defense classes. Pretty unlikely, because all the people she defeated would also have had to have really lucky matches (like a lot of grandmas just field-goal kicking toddlers out of the ring), but extremely possible. Which brings us to the most critical and overlooked issue with this battle royal: How do we force two newborns to fight? Like sure some are fiesty, but... I dunno.  What about two people in a coma? Do we just launch them into each other until one is sufficiently damaged? Lot a details that need to be worked out, is all I'm saying. 
Give both babies honey and if one of them survives, it moves on to the next round.  Coma patients get put in wheelchairs and sent down halls to joust until there’s a winner 
I looked at the other comments suggesting games and other sports to decide the win but I was like nah, I want the fighting... having seen the logical conclusion to that I'd like to go back and think about babies trying to play rock paper scissors or getting absolutely creamed in long jump, or Olympic wrestling. 
The peak fitness highly trained men are in there somewhere. Like I get what you're saying statistically, but no matter how you break it down you can't just math them into non-existence. If you managed to get all the way to the final match without fighting anything but other grandmas, then all the strongest people in the world fought to be the one to face you in that final round. 
 It's possible the top fighter just ends up being a 50 year old woman who'd recently taken a few self defense classes. Pretty unlikely, because all the people she defeated would also have had to have really lucky matches (like a lot of grandmas just field-goal kicking toddlers out of the ring), but extremely possible.  How would that be possible? It is  technically possible 1 person gets to the final because they only faced weak opponents (albeit extremely unlikey with 32 rounds) it is actually impossible for both finalist to have that happen as long as a single strong person exists. 
Ah, but what if the last actual hardass remaining got beaten by a granny in round 32 because he was exhausted and mostly dead after fighting 31 other hardasses?  That granny might have just been matched with babies so far. 
Quite likely better than that: women, children under 14, and the elderly make up 2/3 of the population.  However, with half eliminated each round, you'd only have to reach round 3 before you're looking at only 25% of people remaining; which you'll notice is less than top 1/3rd advantage you got naturally. There will be plenty of peoples who got to this round on lucky matchups, but the odds at this point are already saying you're not likely to have an advantage anymore.  By round 4, you've probably got less than a 5% chance of getting by due to a lucky matchup; you'll probably need to be better than the average healthy middle aged male to move on from here. 
So if Jason Mamoa beats Chris Evans and (insert any decrepit politician here) beats a 2 month old is the politician really the stronger half? Your question only applies if there is an accurate ranking 
I can confidently say that by the like 5th or 6th round we are fighting against mostly above average strength people 
Then one guy makes it to the final round only dunking on babies. 
Well in that case those babies must have somehow won 30 rounds of their own. 
All the babies are bloodlusted and a few babies kept getting put against weaker babies than themself for a few rounds. 
All the babies that won were either against another baby or the contest was something that greatly favored babies, like imagine if the test was just “who is younger” 
I mean... Above average of the entire earth population is like an able bodied middle aged woman who curls 5s. The world has a lot of babies, old people, disabled people and starving people so that's not really saying much. 
Don't assume the old ladies would lose, we don't know what the contest is. It could be knitting or something. 
Even if it is knitting I'd still be the winner because old ladies cannot take a punch. 
 At what point would you start running into very formidable opponents.  Depends on the competition but I like how we all assumed it was some sort of squid games-like death match. If the game was chess, I'd start panicking if my opponent was super old with a fedora or a 13 year old mathlete. My only shot at this would be rock-paper-scissors or coin flips. 
Start: 8 billion. End of Round 1: 4 billion. 2: 2 billion. 3: 1 billion. 4: 500 million. 5: 250 million. 6: 125 million. 7: 64 million. 8: 32 million. 9: 16 million. 10: 8 million. 11: 4 million. 12: 2 million. 13: 1 million. 14: 500 thousand. 15: 250 thousand. 16: 125 thousand. 17: 64 thousand. 18: 32 thousand. 19: 16 thousand. 20: 8 thousand. 21: 4 thousand . 22: 2 thousand. 23: 1 thousand. 24: 500. 25: 250. 26: 125. 27: 64. 28: 32. 29: 16. 30: 8. 31: 4. 32: 2. End of Round 33: 1.      So yeah, checks out, please note simplification at 125/2 -> 64 to make it neater to write.      /u/FishPasteGuy has a good explanation of the weird rounding i did.     For those who want to understand the weird rounding required at Round 26:      26: 125. (One gets set aside so 124). 27: 62. 28: 31. (Add back the set aside person so 32). 29: 16. 30: 8. 31: 4. 32: 2. 33: Winner. 
So I'm only 33 battles away from ruling the entire planet. Good to know. 
  Your first battle is convincing everyone else they need to battle too
